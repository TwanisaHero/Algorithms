| 1  | [A03](A03/)   | **Binary Search Tree (BST) â€“ Delete Method**<br>Implement deletion in a BST, handling all cases (leaf, one child, two children). |
| 2  | [H01](H01/)   | **AVL Tree Basics**<br>Implement AVL tree insertions and ensure the tree remains height-balanced. |
| 3  | [H02](H02/)   | **AVL Tree Insertion with Rotations**<br>Insert a sequence of nodes into an AVL tree, perform LL, RR, LR, RL rotations as needed, and document the steps. |
| 4  | [P01](P01/)   | **Red-Black Tree Presentation**<br>Create and present a visual explanation of red-black trees, including properties, insertions, and balancing. |
| 5  | [A04](A04/)   | **Hashing and Collision Handling**<br>Explore and implement open hashing (chaining) and closed hashing (open addressing), along with collision resolution techniques. |
