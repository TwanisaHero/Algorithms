## 📝 Overview

In this assignment, you will insert a sequence of integers into an AVL tree and analyze the rebalancing process. These sequences are designed to trigger **single** and **double rotations**. Your tasks include:

- Constructing AVL trees from the given sequences.
- Identifying where **imbalances** occur.
- Applying the correct **rotations** (LL, RR, LR, RL).
- Documenting the **final tree structure**.
- Drawing **step-by-step transformations** for one selected set.

## 📊 Sets & Rotations

### 🔢 **Set 1**: Left-Right and Right-Left Rotations
**Insertions:** `10, 20, 30, 15, 25, 5, 35, 27`  
- Identify **LR and RL rotations**.
- Show intermediate steps and final structure.

### 🔢 **Set 2**: Multiple Rotations in Different Branches
**Insertions:** `50, 40, 45, 60, 55, 70, 35, 30, 65, 75, 43`  
- Identify **LL**, **RR**, **LR**, and **RL** rotations.

### 🔢 **Set 3**: Alternating Insertions Causing Frequent Rebalancing
**Insertions:** `100, 90, 110, 80, 95, 85, 105, 120, 102, 108`  
- Frequent rebalancing occurs deep in the tree.
- Track all **rebalancing steps** and resulting structure.

## 💡 Bonus Challenge (Optional)
- Remove a node after all insertions.
- Perform necessary **rotations** to rebalance.
- Show the **final balanced tree**.
